11/2 am
-adjust user stories
-create: seperate functions for drawing player cards and computer cards
 -- fixed: draw_player_card shows [] 0 when we print score -> move to inside deal cards function

(seperate functions for updating scores ? for now just use sum method)

-create conditionals for player and computer turns
  while player_turn "Do you want to hit?"
  while computer_turn draw_card()
  while not computer and not player

-blackjack and over_21 conditions must be passed before we ask the user is they want a new card
--blackjack should be a function
--over_21 should be a function
--game over

scoping issue,
need to move draw_card actions outside of draw() function
