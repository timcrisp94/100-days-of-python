# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year. 

# > `on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# >   **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# >     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400`

# e.g. The year 2000:

# 2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)

# 2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

# 2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)

# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
