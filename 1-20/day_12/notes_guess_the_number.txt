AAU I should be greeted with a welcome message and instructions
-welcome, instructions
-number = randint()
--print number (for dev)

AAU I should be able to choose a difficulty
-input, "choose easy or hard"
--if easy: guesses = 10, print "You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number."
--else: guesses = 5, print "You have 5 ..."

AAU I should be able to make a guess
-input, "make a guess"

AAU I should be told if my guess was correct or incorrect
-print "Make a guess: {guess}
-if guess not == number:
  guesses -= 1
  -if guess < number: 
    print (f"too low\nGuess again\nYou have {guesses} remaining"
    (back to make a guess -while loop-)
  -else: print (f"too high\nGuess again\nYou have {guesses} remaining")
-else print "You got it! Answer was {number}."
